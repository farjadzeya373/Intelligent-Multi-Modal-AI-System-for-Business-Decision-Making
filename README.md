# Intelligent Multi-Modal AI System for Business Decision Making

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning system designed to support
business decision-making by combining structured data processing, predictive modeling,
and model deployment as a REST API.

The system covers the complete ML lifecycle:
- Data ingestion
- Data preprocessing & feature scaling
- Model training & evaluation
- Model serialization
- API-based inference using Flask

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Businesses often rely on historical data to predict customer behavior and optimize
decisions. This system demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained,
evaluated, and deployed to make real-time predictions that assist in decision-making.
